# Patatap Clone Project

A vanilla recreation of patatap.com. 
A fun little project showing a little of what other JavaScript libraries can do. In this case I used Paper.js (the animations) and Howler.js (the sounds). It creates circles of different colors corresponding with a key on the keyboard (just the letters) with a special sound for each letter key.
